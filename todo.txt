Lore

Europe is in a state of constant dread and war-readiness - the two superpowers of the USSR and Francia have cornered Europe.
Minor powers frantically leap to their neighbours to create their own blocs, hoping to withstand the inevitable flood of armies from both west & east.


Overall theme

The lore is sorta bleak but the theme of the mod will be incredibly goofy shit like astolfo path



Spain.

- Ask a Spain player what makes playing Spain fun.
   a. Try to find out if they like the civil war/what is even fun about that dumb civil war.
- Preferably remove civil war. Depends on the previous missions findings tho.


Pink Union
  Poland

  - ASTOLFO PATH!
     a. MAKE IT BREAK THE 4TH WALL!
  - Path to get Hungary into the Pink Union.

  Czechoslovakia

  - Divide Sudetenland into 2-3 states.
  - Influence Saxony (vague idea)


Germany

- Break the 2 Prussian states into smaller fragments for more palatable Poland/Soviet borders and overall map painting.
- Make Stettin a state.
- Germany and its usual dynamic in HOI4 mods will be flipped on it's head: it's going to be really weak and it's going to be VERY hard to unify Germany back.
- Rename to Prussia? (Deutsche Republik)


Austria

- Austria-Hungary path for all the AH soyjaks. (I don't like Austria-Hungary as u can tell)
- Austro-Bavarian Union mechanic (maybe)

FRANCIA!!!!!

- Britanny, Mecklenburg = puppets.
- Have to constantly manage their territories via decisions, as to not break apart. When in war, this mechanic is paused.

UK

- Isolationist.



Livonia

- Integration Path
- Demand Soviet territories and then (willingly) leave USSR
- Polish path that declares war with soviet union with pink faction 
- UK path which shows democracy and neutrality
- French path to gain stake in baltic lands (Lithuania, Prussia, Belarus etc.), and deport russians, becoming french eastern territory
- (Possible) Sweden path to go away from USSR captivity leading in you becoming swedish sphere of infleunce. (idk i wanna plan this more later)

Yugoslavia

- Clash of Clans path. Canonically Clash of Clans was set in 1930s Yugoslavia.
- Jackets normal historical path.

Bulgaria

- Macedonian Crisis
- Yugo-War intervention
- National crisis if macedonian crisis outcome is unfavourable
- Demand Thrace, Dobrudja, Constantinople via foci
- Monarchist path/Military Gov path/Restoration of Byz
- HRE (or Rome) path for the lols
