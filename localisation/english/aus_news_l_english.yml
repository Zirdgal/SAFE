Emerging victorious is the far-left Austromarxist, Ruth Fischer. Despite more moderate options in the form of Adolf Schicklgruber and Otto Glöckel, Fischer won by two votes, marking a radical shift left for the party in recent years.\n\nFischer is a long-stay in Austro-Bavarian politics, having been active since 1922 and responsible for numerous organized strikes in the 1920s. Fischer states her goal is to speed up the implementation of socialism and combat the growing radical right."

The victorious moderate compromiser, Otto Glöckel, a good friend of beloved former president Karl Seitz, has been victorious by a thin margin of only ten votes.\n\nGlöckel's speech both prior to and after the vote was very heavy-handed in its approach to the Bavarian situation. The Bavarian political scene reignited with secessionist thought after Seitz' resignation, and Glöckel promises tough crack-downs on these movements, as well as the more extreme parts of the radical right, such as the paramilitary Sturmkorps."

With an astronomically close vote, Adolf Schicklgruber, a so-called "right social democrat," has come out on top with only five more votes than his opponents.\n\nSchicklgruber, a famous artist and war hero from Braunau am Inn on the Bavarian border, has been an outspoken social democrat for a few years, but recently stepped up as a member of the party itself. In his nomination speech, he explained that the reason for the sharp turn towards radicalism the right has taken was created of the party's own volition due to their own radicalism, and promises to deradicalize the party."

His efforts saved his party and his country, earning him the moniker "the Great Compromiser," and his legacy is cherished on both sides of the political spectrum. Unfortunately, due to worsening health, Seitz has been forced to resign, and without a successor, the parliament is barely governing the country. Combined with far-right attacks on the government, Austria-Bavaria's situation is critical."
