 habsburg_law_debate_desc:0 "The Fatherland Front's predecessors were in an uproar when the Habsburg Law was passed, and these neo-imperialist reactionaries still salivate when fantasizing about repealing it. Now they have proposed another repeal, and at the worst time considering our current crisis. Some of our own deputies are even suggesting we cave to their demands, claiming there is little the pretender in Dresden could do."

 constituent_national_assembly_desc:0 "The Konstituierende Nationalversammlung, or Constituent National Assembly, is the legislative body of the Austrian-Bavarian Republic. It is among the most progressive institutions in Europe, a fact Austrians either proudly revere or scoff at, due to the universal suffrage present in its elections. The Assembly is the backbone of the last true democracy in Europe, but it is a frail one."

 fallout_agrarian_subsidy_cuts_desc:0 "In early 1933, the Austrian and Bavarian farmlands were hit by a crisis as a result of government neglect and mismanagement. In order to save agriculture, the Assembly almost unanimously passed a number of subsidies on several agrarian and agricultural industries. These mostly impacted larger businesses, but also raised small farmers' profits by an average of 5%. So, when in November of 1935 the Assembly voted to repeal most of these subsidies as part of the 1936 budget, many small farmers, supported in secret by Big Agriculture, were outraged, and called for the repeals to be reversed. The deputies who voted for the repeals stood fast during a second round of voting, further intensifying the farmers' anger. Now the Fatherland Front is exploiting this outrage for their own gains, despite many of their deputies being in favor of cutting the subsidies, and they are holding marches and rallies across Austria and Bavaria. The situation is hitting a critical point, especially with Seitz having turned to recluse in face of his worsening illness."
