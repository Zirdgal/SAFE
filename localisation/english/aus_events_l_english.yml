 march_crisis.1.d:0 "Karl Seitz, the Great Compromiser, a man respected by many from all corners of the political spectrum for his political prowess that brought the SDAPÖB back from the brink of collapse, the man who is currently holding together not just his party but his entire country, has resigned.\n\nSeitz has been suffering from an unknown illness for the better part of a year now. Everyone could see it and everyone was worried. His resignation would mean the party and government fell. Seitz would hold out as long as possible, but on 27 February, his illness suddenly worsened greatly, and he was hospitalized. On 2 March, he held a speech broadcasted over radio declaring that his lung cancer had worsened beyond his control and he would be stepping down from all political positions to spend time with his family.\n\nThe Fatherland Front has acted relatively normal about the whole affair, but the communists and orthodox socialists within the SDAPÖB have already sprung into action. They demand the SDAPÖB holds a party congress to elect a new chairman, and therefore president. Meanwhile, the moderate elements of the party are scrambling to put together some kind of leadership. Nothing has come of that yet. Whatever happens over the next few weeks will decide Austria-Bavaria's future."

 march_crisis.2.d:0 "In 1924, in the harrowing months following the shaky ceasefire and the negotiating of the Prague treaty, a number of laws were passed by the SDAPÖB during their seven months of near unopposed rule that were unpopular then and flashpoints now. Many of them were repealed or the terms renegotiated during Seitz' time as President, but one in particular has remained an untouchable subject.\n\nThe Habsburg Law, or in full the Law concerning the Expulsion and the Takeover of the Assets of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, was the first law passed, only six days in to the Republic. The law strips the Habsburg family of their sovereign rights and banishes them from Austria-Bavaria. A revision three weeks later added that Karl I would not be permitted to return, although other members of the family could return if they renounce dynastic claims and accepted private citizen status, and seized all property owned by the Habsburgs in Austria, including funds.\n\nThe right wing of the political spectrum has for years decried the law as inhumane and unnecessary, a movement only growing in strength with the reactionary Fatherland Front stepping up to push anti-establishment propaganda. With Seitz resigning, the Front took it upon themselves to propose their seventh attempt at repealing the law, and with the SDAPÖB in anarchy, they may be able to sway enough of our more sympathetic deputies to their cause..."
