 march_crisis.1.d:0 "Karl Seitz, the Great Compromiser, a man respected by many from all corners of the political spectrum for his political prowess that brought the SDAPÖB back from the brink of collapse, the man who is currently holding together not just his party but his entire country, has resigned.\n\nSeitz has been suffering from an unknown illness for the better part of a year now. Everyone could see it and everyone was worried. His resignation would mean the party and government fell. Seitz would hold out as long as possible, but on 27 February, his illness suddenly worsened greatly, and he was hospitalized. On 2 March, he held a speech broadcasted over radio declaring that his lung cancer had worsened beyond his control and he would be stepping down from all political positions to spend time with his family.\n\nThe Fatherland Front has acted relatively normal about the whole affair, but the communists and orthodox socialists within the SDAPÖB have already sprung into action. They demand the SDAPÖB holds a party congress to elect a new chairman, and therefore president. Meanwhile, the moderate elements of the party are scrambling to put together some kind of leadership. Nothing has come of that yet. Whatever happens over the next few weeks will decide Austria-Bavaria's future."

 march_crisis.2.d:0 "In 1924, in the harrowing months following the shaky ceasefire and the negotiating of the Prague treaty, a number of laws were passed by the SDAPÖB during their seven months of near unopposed rule that were unpopular then and flashpoints now. Many of them were repealed or the terms renegotiated during Seitz' time as President, but one in particular has remained an untouchable subject.\n\nThe Habsburg Law, or in full the Law concerning the Expulsion and the Takeover of the Assets of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, was the first law passed, only six days in to the Republic. The law strips the Habsburg family of their sovereign rights and banishes them from Austria-Bavaria. A revision three weeks later added that Karl I would not be permitted to return, although other members of the family could return if they renounce dynastic claims and accepted private citizen status, and seized all property owned by the Habsburgs in Austria, including funds.\n\nThe right wing of the political spectrum has for years decried the law as inhumane and unnecessary, a movement only growing in strength with the reactionary Fatherland Front stepping up to push anti-establishment propaganda. With Seitz resigning, the Front took it upon themselves to propose their seventh attempt at repealing the law, and with the SDAPÖB in anarchy, they may be able to sway enough of our more sympathetic deputies to their cause..."

 march_crisis.3.d:0 "Otto von Habsburg, the pretender to the Austrian throne, has taken up a peculiar interest during his time at Leipzig University. He had joined a small but dedicated club centered around the concept of Pan-Europeanism early in his time there, and the idea clearly stuck. His thesis paper was entirely dedicated to the topic. Titled 'European Cooperation and Integration as Planned for the 21st Century,' Otto's thesis details a plan to increase cooperation and integration of European states with the ultimate goal of a united federation by the year 2000.\n\nJust after his graduation in 1935, Otto, alongside his peers in the club, formed an organization headquartered in Dresden called the Paneuropa Bund, or Pan-European League. The goal of the League is vague, but can be boiled down to essentially spreading the ideas outlined in his thesis, which has become the backbone of the organization, in the vain hope someone impoartant will pick up on them.\n\nAfter a year of the League and its associated newspaper of the same name only losing money for Otto and his clique, an opportunity presented itself. The Fatherland Front in his home nation of Austria had just managed to repeal his exile. He immediately set off for Vienna, and upon arrival, met by tens of thousands of supporters, Otto declared his intention to convert his political organization in Dresden into a proper party in Austria-Bavaria, with the ultimate goal of uniting Europe under the Habsburg banner.\n\nWhile more moderate conservatives and monarchists have thrown their support behind Otto, the reactionary Volksrepublikaner faction of the Fatherland front has began seething at the loss of a large portion of their support base. In fact, an emergency party meeting is scheduled to take place in Munich just two weeks from now. What will become of the reactionaries is yet to be seen."

 march_crisis.4.d:0 "Seitz' resignation, as everyone expected, immediately resulted in total anarchy within the SDAPÖB.\n\nThe Austromarxists and their newspaper, the aptly titled 'Austromarxismus,' immediately twisted some selected phrases from his resignation speech to portray him as endorsing the Austromarxists, while the right wing of the party began pushing for a party congress, already within a day of the resignation campaigning amongst their fellow parties members with promises of deradicalizing the party to subdue far-right aggression. The relative centrists and compromisers scrambled to announce elections and convene this congress, but gave it two purposes. First, it would choose an interim president with limited powers just to keep order intact for the next few weeks. However, this vote would also decide who would be the candidate for the upcoming election.\n\nAfter much bickering on who would present their candidate first, Adolf Schicklgruber simply walked to the podium and began speaking. Schicklgruber began by recapping the past few months of right-wing radicalism, and proclaimed that this all originated from the party's own radicalism in the late 1920s. Schicklgruber announced that his party's main goal would be to deradicalize their own party and pull back on the more socialist and extreme progressive polciymaking from the last few years.\n\nAfter Schicklgruber's speech, he requested the moderate candidate, Otto Glöckel, speak next. Glöckel began his own speech by stressing the need for party unity. Rather than portraying the right as the party's own creation, Glöckel began fearmongering about the right's paramilitary action and propaganda, proclaiming the need to hold fast in these trying times. He also decried the Bavarian political parties reactivating, and demanding the party put their foot down and reign in the nationalists.\n\nLastly, Ruth Fischer of the Austromarxist faction within the SDAPÖB gave her speech. Rather than trying to unite the party or stress the need to deradicalize, Fischer pressed the party for not going far enough. The uncomfortable transition phase trying to mix and match from socialism and capitalism is what's radicalizing the right, and if the party only pushed through and achieved socialism instead, then the farmers and conservatives would see what socialism could really bring and flock to them.\n\nApproaching dusk, the party chose to end the meeting with that and hold the vote at noon the next day. After the night and morning passed, the party reconvened and passed out the ballots. After they were all collected, one of the party members who had helped organize the convention read out loud the results, to ensure there was no election fraud. At the end of the count, it was announced that the candidate who won was..."
