 march_crisis.1.d:0 "Karl Seitz, the Great Compromiser, a man respected by many from all corners of the political spectrum for his political prowess that brought the SDAPÖB back from the brink of collapse, the man who is currently holding not just his party but his entire country, has resigned.\n\nSeitz has been suffering from an unknown illness for the better part of a year now. Everyone could see it and everyone was worried. His resignation would mean the party and government fell. Seitz would hold out as long as possible, but on 27 February, his illness suddenly worsened greatly, and he was hospitalized. On 2 March, he held a speech broadcasted over radio declaring that his lung cancer had worsened beyond his control and he would be stepping down from all political positions to spend time with his family.\n\nThe Fatherland Front has acted relatively normal about the whole affair, but the communists and orthodox socialists within the SDAPÖB have already sprung into action. They demand the SDAPÖB holds a party congress to elect a new chairman, and therefore president. Meanwhile, the moderate elements of the party are scrambling to put together some kind of leadership. Nothing has come of that yet. Whatever happens over the next few weeks will decide Austria-Bavaria's future."
