 AUS_KARL_SEITZ_DESC:0 "Born in Vienna in 1869, the young Karl Seitz grew up in rough conditions. His father was a struggling coal trader who passed away when Seitz was only six, and afterwards his family was thrown into the pits of poverty. He was sent to an orphanage not too long later, and still managed to recieve decent education and earned a scholarship. Into the 1890s, Seitz had already become an active social democrat, founding a teachers' union in 1896, which resulted in him being terminated from teaching. Now, he became a full-time political activist, and over the course of the next two decades found himself growing in recognition within the SDAPÖ. In the early 1920s, with the outbreak of the Great Balkan War, he found himself the SDAPÖ's leading pacifist voice, objecting to the aggressive war painted as a preemptive attack. Once the tide of the war had turned, and the Frankish Empire had intervened against the South German Confederation, the emperor, Karl I, abdicated the throne and the SDAPÖ took the reigns. They immediately declared a republic, and sued for peace against the coalition. Seitz was offered the presidency, but declined and instead ran for mayor of Vienna. In the late 1920s, the SDAPÖ had nearly split between the moderate and radical members. Despite nearing his sixties and being almost out of the political scene, Seitz stepped up and managed to sew the party back together, earning him the nickname "der große Kompromissgeber" - the Great Compromiser. He accepted the presidency in his predecessor's absence, and quickly stabilized the political scene. But nearly a decade later, the Great Compromiser is getting weaker, and ailing health has led to him partially retiring, terrifying the party beyond belief. If Seitz resigns, the party will collapse."
