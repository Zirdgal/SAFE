 AUS_CHARACTER_KARL_SEITZ:0 "Karl Seitz"
 AUS_KARL_SEITZ_DESC:0 "Born in Vienna in 1869, the young Karl Seitz grew up in rough conditions. His father was a struggling coal trader who passed away when Seitz was only six, and afterwards his family was thrown into the pits of poverty. He was sent to an orphanage not too long later, and still managed to recieve decent education and earned a scholarship. Into the 1890s, Seitz had already become an active social democrat, founding a teachers' union in 1896, which resulted in him being terminated from teaching. Now, he became a full-time political activist, and over the course of the next two decades found himself growing in recognition within the SDAPÖ. In the early 1920s, with the outbreak of the Great Balkan War, he found himself the SDAPÖ's leading pacifist voice, objecting to the aggressive war painted as a preemptive attack. Once the tide of the war had turned, and the Frankish Empire had intervened against the South German Confederation, the emperor, Karl I, abdicated the throne and the SDAPÖ took the reigns. They immediately declared a republic, and sued for peace against the coalition. Seitz was offered the presidency, but declined and instead ran for mayor of Vienna. In the late 1920s, the SDAPÖ had nearly split between the moderate and radical members. Despite nearing his sixties and being almost out of the political scene, Seitz stepped up and managed to sew the party back together, earning him the nickname "der große Kompromissgeber" - the Great Compromiser. He accepted the presidency in his predecessor's absence, and quickly stabilized the political scene. But nearly a decade later, the Great Compromiser is getting weaker, and ailing health has led to him partially retiring, terrifying the party beyond belief. If Seitz resigns, the party will collapse."
 AUS_CHARACTER_OTTO_HABSURG:0 "Otto von Habsburg"
 AUS_OTTO_HABSBURG_DESC:0 "Born in 1912, just a few short years before the Great Balkan War, Otto von Habsburg grew up in a time of strife for the South German Confederation. When his father, Karl I, took over the frail nation in 1916, Otto became heir apparent at the age of four, and subsequently spent the next few years being trained to take over the throne. It would all be for nought, however, when his father abdicated the throne in 1923 and fled with most of his family, including Otto, to Saxony. After the end of the Great Balkan War and the foundation of the republic in Austria-Bavaria, the so-called "Habsburg Law" was signed into law by the SDAPÖ and other left-wing deputies, banishing the Habsburgs from Austria ad infinitum and seizing their property. Karl I would soon die of a severe case pneumonia caught during the trek to Saxony, and Otto would become pretender to the throne. During the early 1930s to now, he has become quite active politically, and in 1935 he formed the Paneuropa Bund, or Pan-European League, an organization that aims to reduce European tensions and increase cooperations. With the repeal of the Habsburg Law in early 1936, Otto returned to Austria, and against the wishes of the Fatherland Front that had proposed the repeal, turned the Paneuropa Bund into a legal political party in Austria. Riding the waves of restorationist sentiment and lack of faith in the SDAPÖ, Otto managed to secure the election and was inaugurated as President of Austria. What he shall do now is up for debate, but what is clear is that Europe is in for one wild ride..."
 AUS_CONSTITUENT_NATIONAL_ASSEMBLY:0 "Constituent National Assembly"
 AUS_CONSTITUENT_NATIONAL_ASSEMBLY_DESC:0 "After Seitz' resignation, the Assembly has been forced to take over as acting president until a new president is found. But, like all governing bodies comprised of multiple people, arguments are inevitable and the government is essentially deadlocked."
 AUS_CHARACTER_OTTO_GLOCKEL:0 "Otto Glöckel"
 AUS_OTTO_GLOCKEL_DESC:0 "Otto Glöckel was born in Pottendorf to a junior school teacher in 1874. After his time in elementary and middle school, he studied to become a teacher at a teachers' college in Wiener Neustadt. He joined the SDAPÖ in 1894 and helped Karl Seitz found his teachers' union two years later. Shortly after marrying Leopoldine Glöckel, another social democratic activist, in 1897, Otto was dismissed from teaching by the Austrian mayor. In 1907, he was a member of the South German Reichsrat, and was one of the greatest proponents of the anti-war faction. Following the collapse of the Habsburg realm, Glöckel was assigned Minister of Education and introduced many reforms to the school system, including separation of church and school. Into the early 1930s, Glöckel would continue implementing reforms to the school system, but after Karl Seitz' resignation in March 1936 he would step down in order to persue the candidacy to continue Seitz' policies."
 AUS_CHARACTER_RUTH_FISCHER:0 "Ruth Fischer"
 AUS_RUTH_FISCHER_DESC:0 "Ruth Fischer was born in Leipzig, Saxony, in 1895 to an Austrian professor of philosophy teaching in Leipzig. Fischer studied philosophy, economics, and politics at the University of Vienna, and in 1922 joined the underground Communist Party of Austria. The KPÖ had been formed in 1921 in an attempt to sabotage the already flailing Habsburg war effort, but only during the final weeks of the war did any of their sabotage efforts have any real effect. During the snap elections in 1924, the KPÖ earned the third largest number of seats in the Constituent National Assembly, only behind the SDAPÖ and the CSP. Fischer was chosen as one of the deputies to the Assembly. In 1930, with the right wing rapidly consolidating into a single entity, the SDAPÖB approached the KPÖ with an offer to consolidate a broad left front against the conservative-reactionary alliance. The contemporary party leader, Karl Steinhardt, was opposed to the idea but was essentially kicked out of his own party for it and Fischer was instead elected to lead the party, and she opted to unite with the SDAPÖB. Fischer worked closely with Seitz and the moderate SDAPÖB despite their differences, and almost immediately after Seitz' resignation she began pushing for the SDAPÖB to hold a vote on an emergency president, and the Austromarxist faction immediately nominated her as a candidate."

 AUS_CHARACTER_ADOLF_SCHICKLGRUBER:0 "Adolf Schicklgruber"
 AUS_ADOLF_SCHICKLGRUBER_DESC:0 "Adolf Schicklgruber was born in 1889 in Braunau am Inn near the Bavarian border to Alois Schicklgruber and his third wife, Klara. When he was three, his family moved to Passau in southern Bavaria until 1894, when they moved back to Austria in Leonding and later Hafeld. In early 1896, when Schicklgruber was six, his father Alois suffered a heart attack and would later pass away due to complications as a result. With five children to take care of, Klara and the Schicklgruber family would struggle for the next several years, living in poverty but not outright destitution. Eventually, with his mother's approval, Adolf attended a classical high school starting in 1900 where he studied art. In 1907, Adolf left for Vienna to study fine art, and was accepted by the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. Towards the end of the year, Klara died of breast cancer at 47, and without her financial support nearly ran out of money. However, between support from connections made at the Academy of Fine Arts and selling paintings of Vienna's landmarks, he was able to sustain a decent if difficult life. During the 1910s, Schicklgruber's luck began to rise and towards the end of the decade had become a local celebrity in Vienna and a few surrounding cities. In 1921, following the second wave of mobilization for the Great Balkan War, Schicklgruber was conscripted. He was placed into the 4th Landwehr, which fought first in Bosnia-Herzegovina then in southern Bavaria and Tyrol during the Frankish intervention. Schicklgruber would be wounded thrice, twice at the hands of shrapnel and once due to a Frankish gas attack. After the war, Schicklgruber painted a series of paintings known as 'Der Krieg,' which were renowned across not only Austria but most of Europe for its horrific depictions of the Great Balkan War and war in general. During the 1920s, Schicklgruber joined the SDAPÖB, but never was particularly involved in politics until the early 1930s. Horrified by the Völkisch movement growing in the far-right, Schicklgruber began forming a clique within the SDAPÖB known as the right social democrats. Unlike most in the party, Schicklgruber believes the far-right was created as a result of the party's own radicalism, and intends on reigning in the radical elements of the party."
