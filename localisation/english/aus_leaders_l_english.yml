 AUS_CHARACTER_KARL_SEITZ:0 "Karl Seitz"
 AUS_KARL_SEITZ_DESC:0 "Born in Vienna in 1869, the young Karl Seitz grew up in rough conditions. His father was a struggling coal trader who passed away when Seitz was only six, and afterwards his family was thrown into the pits of poverty. He was sent to an orphanage not too long later, and still managed to recieve decent education and earned a scholarship. Into the 1890s, Seitz had already become an active social democrat, founding a teachers' union in 1896, which resulted in him being terminated from teaching. Now, he became a full-time political activist, and over the course of the next two decades found himself growing in recognition within the SDAPÖ. In the early 1920s, with the outbreak of the Great Balkan War, he found himself the SDAPÖ's leading pacifist voice, objecting to the aggressive war painted as a preemptive attack. Once the tide of the war had turned, and the Frankish Empire had intervened against the South German Confederation, the emperor, Karl I, abdicated the throne and the SDAPÖ took the reigns. They immediately declared a republic, and sued for peace against the coalition. Seitz was offered the presidency, but declined and instead ran for mayor of Vienna. In the late 1920s, the SDAPÖ had nearly split between the moderate and radical members. Despite nearing his sixties and being almost out of the political scene, Seitz stepped up and managed to sew the party back together, earning him the nickname "der große Kompromissgeber" - the Great Compromiser. He accepted the presidency in his predecessor's absence, and quickly stabilized the political scene. But nearly a decade later, the Great Compromiser is getting weaker, and ailing health has led to him partially retiring, terrifying the party beyond belief. If Seitz resigns, the party will collapse."
 AUS_CHARACTER_OTTO_HABSURG:0 "Otto von Habsburg"
 AUS_OTTO_HABSBURG_DESC:0 "Born in 1912, just a few short years before the Great Balkan War, Otto von Habsburg grew up in a time of strife for the South German Confederation. When his father, Karl I, took over the frail nation in 1916, Otto became heir apparent at the age of four, and subsequently spent the next few years being trained to take over the throne. It would all be for nought, however, when his father abdicated the throne in 1923 and fled with most of his family, including Otto, to Saxony. After the end of the Great Balkan War and the foundation of the republic in Austria-Bavaria, the so-called "Habsburg Law" was signed into law by the SDAPÖ and other left-wing deputies, banishing the Habsburgs from Austria ad infinitum and seizing their property. Karl I would soon die of a severe case pneumonia caught during the trek to Saxony, and Otto would become pretender to the throne. During the early 1930s to now, he has become quite active politically, and in 1935 he formed the Paneuropa Bund, or Pan-European League, an organization that aims to reduce European tensions and increase cooperations. With the repeal of the Habsburg Law in early 1936, Otto returned to Austria, and against the wishes of the Fatherland Front that had proposed the repeal, turned the Paneuropa Bund into a legal political party in Austria. Riding the waves of restorationist sentiment and lack of faith in the SDAPÖ, Otto managed to secure the election and was inaugurated as President of Austria. What he shall do now is up for debate, but what is clear is that Europe is in for one wild ride..."

 AUS_CONSTITUENT_NATIONAL_ASSEMBLY_DESC:0 "After Seitz' resignation, the Assembly has been forced to take over as acting president until a new president is found. But, like all governing bodies comprised of multiple people, arguments are inevitable and the government is essentially deadlocked."
